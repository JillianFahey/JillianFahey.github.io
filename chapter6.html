			Chapter 6<br />Hate

		<div class="rlbook">
			<p>
				Hate. Hate is a forceful word, used in anger and felt with bitterness. Hate inside of one's heart creates only destruction.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve been hated, hated so badly that I felt no one cared about me anymore. Hated to a level where I felt my life no longer had value. Hated so badly that I was in my room, drenched in tears, texting a friend who lives hundreds of miles away, just to feel love. Desperately searching and living through passages I wrote from times ago when I felt important and happy. I don’t understand and never will understand how people can have such negativity in their lives. Friends who no longer care. Friends who tell you to your face that you are no longer wanted around them. Friends who do not talk to you, best friends. Friends since kindergarten, who listen to your distress and hurt, then disregard it and continue to push you down. Best friends, who swore they would never hurt you like you have been previously hurt. Who then hurt you even more than before with their gut wrenching disregard and negativity.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have to accept and you have to accept that all you can do is distance yourself from that negativity, it only shows their own corruption. No one is obligated to hate anyone, it is a poor choice that many choose to abide by. Find the friends who will cherish you and cherish them with all you have. Don’t spend a second of your time focusing on their hate, instead cherish the great people in your life and discover more positive people to surround yourself with. Hate is too hard on anyone and no one deserves to feel hated.
