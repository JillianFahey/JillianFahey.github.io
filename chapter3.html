			Kindness. The act everyone wishes was acted upon them. It has the ability to unite clashing forces, give a desperate individual hope, and promotes peace. For me, I found the eternal power of kindness by hitting rock bottom. Numb; my whole body was left numb. Heavy tears slowly dripped down my broken face. Broken, they left me feeling so broken that I couldn’t lift a speck of food, murmur a word, or feel anything inside my cold body. In my head I heard the voices of half the school whispering my flaws inside my ear, pushing me to end my hopeless life and telling me it would make their lives better. At twelve years old I was told time and time again by half of the school, that I should kill myself. In choir, where I felt free to express myself and enjoy music, I was left bruised from being thrown out of my chair by older classmates, leaving me unwilling to enjoy my only escape from reality. At lunch my friends treated me as though I was invisible; they talked over me and stopped responding to my comments. I got used to the constant silence, so I continued to stay quiet with all of my emotions and held them inside of me like boiling water, steaming to get out. Every morning I woke up with pulsing nausea leaving my body weak. I would start my day off in tears begging my mom to let me stay home since my anxiety made every second a fight against vomiting. After a year of constant humiliation at school and online I broke, and when I broke I fell hard against the floor and laid broken. I vanished from school and town because the anxiety of interacting with my bullies drove me to breakdown into uncontrollable shaking, sobbing and nail biting pain. People started rumors about my disappearance, spreading that I killed myself, went to a hospital to help with my nonexistent anorexia, or that I moved away because I was “weak.” I felt as though the whole town was staring at me in disgust.

			I transitioned to an independent study school and began to thrive. The only thing that dug me out of that darkness were people who showed me love and dedication. The kind faces at my new school, that understood my pain and genuinely cared about my well being, without even knowing me. Without them, I’m not sure if I would be here to write my story. I learned that kindness and positivity are the foundation of a thriving personality and community.

			From my own struggle I came to realize that energy put towards hatred and discrimination never makes anyone feel better about themselves or happy. Life is too short to use all your energy on being angry with others. Wouldn’t you like to make more room for happiness and positivity? No one wants to look back on the fight they had with a friend for a couple of months and regret not enjoying their time together. You never know which day will be your last, or their last. Keep a smile on your face and I will assure you that a smile will be flashed back towards you. You have the power to alter your life. Would you rather spend all day angry and miserable at everything and everyone; or living your life to the fullest? It is up to you how you use the struggles you have faced. In retrospect, I look at my unfortunate experience with bullying as a reluctant gift that has opened my eyes and heart to others.
