				Friendship. Relationships can be a struggle when you have experienced pain in the past. My past experiences include my feelings being dismissed by others and leaving me feeling so lonely that my heart had no purpose to beat. The fury I had inside of me when I realized most of my pain stemmed from the actions of people I called my friends created a fire able to burn my body to ashes. Most individuals never realize how strongly their actions affect those around them. They live their lives oblivious to the possibility of a loving community and instead follow a selfish path of egotistical actions. I have experienced many of my own and other relationships ending with friends failing to include each other. I find myself painfully alone, once they stop inviting me to activities and slowly exclude me from their lives. I have also watched friends of my own breakdown from the same exclusion from others.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have searched endlessly for friends that will include me and notice when Iâ€™m not around. My advice is that you should try to not make anyone feel alone, but instead make them feel respected and important. Your actions matter. While you may be having fun, think not only of yourself, but of the missing friend who is alone in their room. Feel for their aching heart, one that seems to have no purpose to beat, and be the person that it will beat for.
			<p>
				To those who are alone and desperate for a friend, reach out to others who feel the same way. Talk to a parent, sibling, or family member in order to create a strong and lasting relationship. If all else fails, know your worth because you matter. Your life was given to you for a reason; make your life count. You are never alone, there will always be someone who understands and supports how you are feeling and will be there to guide you. Grow from your pain and remember to never inflict it upon anyone else.
