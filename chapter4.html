			Happiness

				Happiness. One of the most important lessons that I have learned is that happiness is not a destination, but an emotion felt during the journey. Meaning, if you constantly find yourself worrying about “finally being happy,” you will never feel happy. Your brain then disregards all of the moments where you felt happiness because you were too wrapped up trying to make the end product of your life perfect, that you never took advantage of your current blessings. Cherish each time you feel happy and tell yourself, “I am happy, and thankful for this time.” Enjoy every second of it because that joy is often hard to come by.

				The times when happiness seems nonexistent are heartbreaking and discouraging. There are so many days I wasted telling myself “I cannot be happy” or “I will never feel happy again.” Although now I realize, in those moments that I was depressed. In retrospect, I always had the ability to bring myself out of that hole. No one else can determine what brings you happiness, but yourself. The level at which you enjoy life is in your hands.

				When you start to feel unhappy, I suggest finding the one thing you know satisfies you and pursue that. It is extremely hard to tell yourself to think positively when sometimes all your brain can do is fall into a rut of unhappiness. I know this because I have struggled for years with depression and some days I want to feel bad for myself and accept that I cannot feel joy. I can assure you that this thinking is not the path to success, it has only lead me to further self destruction. Instead of continuing to lie on my floor, soaked in tears, I urge myself to pursue music and song writing as my outlet to feel happiness. The words I convey in my songs are a form of therapy for my feelings and relieve pressure from my exhausted brain. Hopefully, everyone has some activity or interest that brings them joy. Everytime you feel unhappy, understand what is leading you to feel that way. If it cannot be dealt with to your liking, step back, stop dwelling on the negative, and pursue your happy place. A healthy diet and proper exercise keep your body healthy as well, which promotes overall happiness. Running, exercising and dancing have always helped improved my mood and cleared my mind. Research also indicates that being in nature and consistent physical activity are beneficial in regulating people’s moods.

				Everyday may present an obstacle in your life, while some may seem like one stair, others may feel like Mount Everest. Remember to cherish the times when all you must overcome is one stair, then experience the joy available that day. Then, when you feel like you are climbing Mount Everest, access that feeling of happiness and remind yourself that every obstacle is approachable with the proper positive mindset, which only you have control over. Happiness is an emotion and it is up to you whether you want to help yourself feel it or not. I suggest being open to a peaceful and authentic mindset, which can guide you to happiness along your life’s journey.
