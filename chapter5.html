				Love. The glue to all wounds. The feeling that sweeps you off your feet, the feeling that connects missing pieces together and the feeling that makes anyone hurting feel recognized, understood and glorified. Love has the ability to bring kindness, happiness and peace together as one unit and makes one feel protected from the ache of the harsh world. Love makes me feel protected from harsh reality and acts like a buffer between us.
			</p>

				Love between all people, regardless of gender, race, religion, and country has power stronger than the universe; and that power is so strong that it has the ability to bring all people together toward one cause. In my opinion, all anyone ever wants is love because love for all means peace for all, happiness for all and kindness for all. Those who are reprimanded for being gay, women who are raped for being female, humans who are killed for being black or Muslim, all they ever crave is love shown towards them. If everyone felt love towards everything and everyone who was different, imagine the strength of our world and the beauty of our earth. You have the power of love running through your blood. You have the power of change inside your heart: all it takes is to love those deserving extra recognition. Our world is unfortunately filled with large amounts of heart-stopping hatred, segregation, and pitiful violence, all due to the lack of love towards every individual and community, no matter their differences. If you desire love, then you owe it to the world to show that desired love to every individual. Love has an endless amount of definitions and levels for the people surrounding you. You do not need to love everyone like you love your family, but you must show even the smallest level of love to everyone because we all deserve a loving community, we all deserve equality and we all deserve a voice that is supported by everyone around us. Every person is a human being and every human being deserves and craves acceptance and peace throughout their life. As long as you radiate the amount of love you desire, love will be gifted back towards you. It may take days, months, or even years, but it will happen. What changed womenâ€™s rights? What changed the rights of African Americans? What changed marriage laws? Love. The answer will always be love, no matter what.

				Love between relationships with those closest to you. I love with all of my heart. I do this because for me, love what keeps me breathing and joyful for the future. Love shown towards me feels like a giant cloud, warm and fluffy, lifting me above all of my struggles and all of my pain, into a world of peace and pleasure. That is why I love as daringly as possible, because I understand the pure magic behind love. I know that my love and our love has the power to create a community stronger than ever before.
