<li>About Me</li>
<li> I was influenced to write this book through my own experience with bullying. Writing has always been a wonderful outlet for myself. I believe there is a limitless amount of power within words, containing a strength able to move individuals and their lives. We learn and teach through our previous experiences, failures and challenges. Writing gifts us the opportunity to convey those stories to others, in hope of a positive change for the future. Together we have the power to create a loving community that supports all people no matter the circumstance. 

My Girl Scout Gold Award has been an inspiration to formulate this project. With the help of my fellow Girl Scouts, Girl Scout leaders and the Girl Scout association, I was able to complete this dream of a project. My friends and family have also given their time and efforts to support this project and deserve a million thanks. 

I am always open to talking with anyone in need of my guidance or friendship, know that you are never alone. Please feel free to email me any questions or concerns you may have. Remember that your life is a gift, so cherish every second of it to the full.</li>
<li>A special thanks to everyone who made this possible!</li>
