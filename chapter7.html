			Chapter 7: Success

		<div class="rlbook">
			<p>
				Success. In life, there is no single measure of success. People will always claim that they know the true definition and may make you feel unworthy, fallen behind, or unsuccessful. The key mindset all individuals must have, is that, like everything else in your life, you get to create your own measure of success that suits you and fulfills your goals. Comparing yourself to others only will leave you feeling worthless. How can you be jealous of someone else becoming a successful doctor, when you do not even enjoy science and may succeed greater as a novelist? There is no comparison to your unique talents and strengths.

				For me, comparing my success to others has been a strain on my mental health and has only caused stress. With school especially, I constantly worry about getting into the best college and the idea of those around me getting into that college without me, leaves me feeling bad about myself and my accomplishments. I forget that while one friend may get into a college that seem “better,” maybe that college was not the best fit for me and my learning style. Instead I can focus on my own great accomplishments and worry only about which college suits me best. In the end if something doesn't work out how you believe it should, another opportunity is the correct path for you because everyone will end up where they are supposed to be.

				Stress and worry are common among people struggling with depression, or just struggling in general. Taking time to realize that your success is measured by yourself only, is beneficial to your mental health and relieves pressure. One of the most important things to remember when you are trying to succeed in life, is that no one can compare to you. Everyone is unique and needs to create their own path in life. In life it is helpful to keep your eyes focused straight ahead on the race set out for you, because if you glance over to the other contestants, you may falter and lose the steady pace you set. Eventually everyone will reach their end, but at their own time. There is no winner at the end of the race of life, but only the memories of how well you cherished the journey, including struggles and triumphs.
