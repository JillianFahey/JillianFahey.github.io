			Peace. Being at peace with yourself and others, bringing peace to the world and peace to every heart. To have peace is to have greatness within you. To be peaceful with others creates a lasting tranquility that no anger, bitterness, or hate can come close to. It may seem hard, and I can assure you it is, but keeping pent up negativity only causes one to harbor pain in the long run. Harboring anger and hostility towards others is like swallowing a poison meant for others, but instead we serve it to ourselves. I know this because I've been torn apart by people, especially those closest to my heart. Everytime I managed to start to piece myself back together, more emotional pain would be inflicted. Throughout the years, the tearing became more forceful, however I found renewed strength whenever I re-focused on instilling inner peace. Inner peace opens the door to forgiveness and radiating kindness toward people, no matter the amount of hurt they caused you, or the hurt the world has caused them. Everyone is struggling with their inner demons, so remember the majority of cruelty hurled your way is typically a reflection of their own negativity and pain, versus a reflection on you.  If someone is unkind towards you, sometimes you can just ignore it, but other times the person may need extra kindness radiated towards them. Peace is not typically oneâ€™s first inclination when they are hurt, but I can assure you that finding peace will shorten the length of your pain and will build resilience for future hurt.
